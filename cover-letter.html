                <p>RE: IT Intern Position</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
                <br>
                <p class="mb-4"> I am writing to express my interest in the IT Intern position at WUCF.  As a current Information Technology student at the University of Central Florida with hands-on experience in customer service and technical training, I am excited about the opportunity to support your IT team while continuing to build my skills in a collaborative and mission-driven environment.  Before switching to IT, I studied aerospace engineering and earned a SolidWorks certification, which developed my problem-solving and technical analysis abilities.  Since changing majors in Spring 2024, I have earned certification in the CPST IT course, where I gained experience with coding, simulations, and troubleshooting systems.  I also have experience using photoshop, excel, word, and other software.  Which are skills that directly align with the expectations of this internship.  My technical training is complemented by more than five years of customer service experience through Publix, where I learned to work under pressure and communicate clearly in team settings.  I am especially drawn to WUCF's mission to reflect and amplify the voices of diverse communities.  The message "You Belong. We Promise." is one that resonates with me personally and professionally.  Your efforts to create an inclusive workplace and programming space through transparent data sharing, inclusive hiring, and local storytelling show a commitment to real change, and I would be proud to contribute to that work from within the IT department.  I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply both my interpersonal and technical skills as an IT Intern at WUCF.  Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and would welcome the opportunity to interview.  I can be reached at (941)-524-4188 or rsemo2002@gmail.com.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Rose Semonick</p>
