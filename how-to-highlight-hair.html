                This project focuses on providing clear, step-by-step instructions for a specific task. The goal is to make a complex process accessible and easy to follow for a general audience, incorporating necessary warnings, tools, and visual aids.

            <h2 class="section-title text-3xl">How to: Highlight Your Hair at Home</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> Everyone knows getting your hair done professionally can at times get expensive and may be inconvenient for people with busy schedules that may not get an opportunity to go to a salon and sit for hours at a time.  Even with that, salons can be booked out for weeks and if someone needed to get their hair done for an event or trip and cannot book an appointment, doing your own hair at home can be a life-saver.  I chose to discuss the steps of highlighting your own hair at home because that is what I have the best experience and knowledge on in regard to doing hair.  This can be an easy process, but it is important to understand techniques and the precautions before starting that could make it difficult.  By following these instructions and accessing the resources provided you should be able to get a good grip on highlighting hair.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Materials/Tools Needed:</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 italic mb-2">*These products can be found at your local beauty store (ex: Sally Beauty)</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Lightener/bleach</li>
                <li>Volume developer</li>
                <li>Toner (not necessary, but for desired results. Makes hair cool/warm/neutral)</li>
                <li>Hair foils (can use regular aluminum foil for cooking)</li>
                <li>Color brush</li>
                <li>Mixing bowl</li>
                <li>Rat-tail comb</li>
                <li>Gloves</li>
                <li>Hair clips (optional-to help with sectioning/neater)</li>
                <li>Mirror</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Warnings & Precautions:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
                <li> Wearing gloves is important to avoid getting bleach on your hands.  Without proper protection, getting bleach on your hands can cause skin irritation.</li>
                <li>Doing a test strand is important before starting the whole process to see how your hair reacts and to see how much it lifts.</li>
                <li>Avoid contact to eyes/mouth.</li>
                <li>Ventilating the area would be helpful since the smell can be strong.</li>
                <li>Do not use metal tools when mixing/applying bleach - can cause chemical reaction.</li>
                <li> Be careful not to overlap bleach onto already bleached hair in order to avoid over-processing and breakage.</li>
                <li> Follow proper developing times to avoid breakage.</li>
                <li> Once you add the volume developer to the lightener and mix, it will start developing and there’s a window on how long it will work once mixed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Quick Start Guide:</h3>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Glossary:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
                <li>**Bleach:** chemical mixture used to lighten hair by breaking hair proteins apart to remove color.</li>
                <li>**Developer:** liquid that activates the bleach.</li>
                <li>**Toner:** color product that adjusts the tone of hair to your liking.</li>
                <li>**Foil method:**  a technique for bleaching or dying hair that keeps the sectioning neat and efficient.  Isolates the hair during processing.</li>
                <li>**Strand test:**  takes a small section of hair with the bleach/volume mix that shows how you hair reacts and if it needs any adjustments.</li>
                <li>**Processing:**  the amount of time for bleach to develop in foils for it to absorb into hair.</li>
                <li>**Slicing:**  splitting the hair into a thin horizontal section to separate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Steps:</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Gather supplies:</h4>
                    <p> Have supplies laid out and prepared. Materials being: mixing bowl, color brush, lightener, volume developer, gloves, rat-tail comb, mirror, and foils that are pre-cut.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Prepping hair:</h4>
                    <p> Brush your hair thoroughly.  If your hair is dirty or oily, wash and dry it the day before for best results.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Section your hair:</h4>
                    <p> divide your hair into four sections. Two in front two in back use clips to secure your sections.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/example-classic-highlight.jpg" alt="Classic Highlight Hair Sectioning" class="my-4"> </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Bleach mixture:</h4>
                    <p> mix 1 part bleach with 1.5 part volume developer.  The level of volume developer depends on how fast you want your hair to process.  10 volume developer would be the least aggressive and could allow for longer processing time while there is 40 developer that works very quickly.  Choosing the volume developer depends on the darkness of your natural hair and your desired lightened result.  It is usually not recommended to do 30 or 40 developers because they can damage the hair and are very strong and work too quickly if doing your own highlights.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/example-hair-dye-mix.jpg" alt="Hair Dye to Developer Ratio" class="my-4"> </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Do a strand test:</h4>
                    <p> by taking a small section and applying the bleach.  Leave on for recommended time and check how your hair lifts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Applying the highlights:</h4>
                    <p> using the foil method, take small strands from each section that are thin, and you can see through.  Slice or weave through the section, leaving one section of the hair out that is not highlighted, and then using the other section place it on the foil and lightly paint bleach on the natural hair.  Repeat on whole head of hair.  Using the method of slicing or weaving, depends on the look of highlights you want.  Slicing, which is just straight through the section would make for more chunky highlights.  Weaving the hair uses the pointed tip of a rat-tail comb to move in a zigzag pattern, lifting up every other tiny strand.  This gives a more dimensional-natural look.</p>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/example-applying-highlights.jpg" alt="Applying Highlights with Foil Method" class="my-4"> </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Wait and monitor:</h4>
                    <p> set a timer usually 20 to 45 minutes depending on your base, natural hair color and desired level of bleach.  Check progress every 10 minutes if one section that you did has completed that time rent out with water while the other sections still developed to avoid over bleaching and breakage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700">Rinse:</h4>
                    <p> When your hair has reached desired level, remove foils and gently rinse out the bleach with lukewarm water.  Shampoo and rinse.  With towel, dried or damp hair, apply the toner to illuminate brassy tones and achieve your desired color.  Each toner will have their own set of instructions, rinse toner out and apply any hair mask or conditioner, then rinse.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Conclusion:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                 In conclusion when highlighting hair, there are techniques and tools, and products that you need to be knowledgeable about as well as informing yourself on your hair and what works best for it.  This process is very expensive at salons and if I doing it at home you’ll spend about $40-$50 in comparison to $200.  In addition, with the at home products that you bought you can do this multiple times before you have to re-buy products.  This is perfect for people who want to take control of their own hair, want to save money, and is convenient for time management.  It can be an easy process, but takes some research and time to figure out.
