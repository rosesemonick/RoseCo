            <h2 class="section-title text-3xl">Screens and Sleep: Exploring the Connection Between Nighttime Screen Use and Sleep Quality in College Students</h2>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Project Objective or Aim:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> This research has the main objective of investigating the correlation between screen use and sleep, more specifically how nighttime screen use affects the quality of sleep amongst UCF undergraduate students.  This project will focus on the psychological and behavioral characteristics and effects that are associated with blue light exposure from smartphones, tablets, and laptop use from students before bed.  By analyzing different peer-reviewed journal articles and recent scientific findings, this project will be able to investigate the impact of screen use both on the mind and body.  We will be paying attention to sleep duration, disruptions in circadian rhythm and overall well-being of the subject.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Project Background and Significance:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> In this day in age everyone and everything uses technology.  UCF undergraduate students more than most must access digital devices frequently to complete their assessments and schoolwork.  Many college students experience chronic sleep deprivation, which can negatively impact their academic performance, behavior, and their physical and mental health.  When we examine what ties into sleep deprivation amongst college students, we can see that one significant contributor is the use of digital screens at night.  This behavior is especially common during later hours of the day.  We can assume this is due to a few factors, such as: available time, deadlines due at midnight, staying up late studying, and decompressing before sleep scrolling on social media.  Devices such as phones, laptops, tablets and televisions emit blue light that delays sleep onset in addition to disrupting circadian rhythms due to suppressed melatonin production.  While by now this may be common knowledge and known information, there has not been recent scientific studies specifically tailored towards the college population.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> This project is important because it is geared towards a specific group that is modifiable by the UCF undergraduate community.  For this project we will be able to study and identify patterns and mechanisms involved in the connection between screen use and sleep.  We can do this by gathering research and analyzing peer reviewed journal articles to examine the behavioral psychology, sleep medicine, and neuroscience behind this correlation.  We can also identify more specific patterns and behaviors linked to nighttime use and digital screens.  We can also look at other factors in the study that can be tested and explored such as the type of content that could play an effect on sleep pattern or if the time spent on the device makes a difference.  By looking at the device type, duration, the type of content being consumed before bed we can more accurately do studies and tests to see what contributes differently to sleep disturbances.  The main guideline for this study involves research on circadian rhythm and sleep hygiene theory.  This pays attention to the body's natural biological clock that is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus that has a high sensitivity to light cues and on the role it has on sleep onset.  Blue light emitted from devices can trick the brain into a delayed release of melatonin due to its wavelength that mimics daylight.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Research Method:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> This project will using a mixed-method approach using a small scaled observational study as well as a survey to investigate how screen use can affect the quality of sleep among college students.</p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-2">Participant Recruitment:</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-4"> For this study, the best way to get specific data in regard to UCF undergraduate students is to advertise and spread the information through campus or campus related sources and advertisements.  We would incorporate UCF affiliated social media platforms, digital flyers on campus, and possibly going to a class that would be catered towards this study to see if any of the students would be interested.</p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-2">Survey Development:</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-4"> We would create an anonymous online survey that would be designed to collect data on students' screen usage patterns (how long/what content), sleep quality levels/quality, and perceived mental health factors (anxiety, irritability, brain fog).  In addition to other factors that may include phone brightness settings (filters/night mode) and the type of device (smartphone, tablet, tv, laptop).</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-4"> We have a target of at 50 submissions for the survey which should give enough data.  Another option that could be opted in for the survey could be using SQS (Sleep Quality Scale) that has a questionnaire provided by the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-2">Sleep-Tracking study:</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-4"> Following the survey, we could include a short sleep study that add more insight based on findings.  A sample of 10-15 voluntary student participants would be selected for a 2-week sleep diary.  The participants would document the following data:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-8 mb-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Track screen usage after 9pm using screen time tracking apps.</li>
                <li>Make note if there are any filters or night mode.</li>
                <li>Time of sleep onset and duration (could use a smart watch or app on Phone to collect data).</li>
                <li>Keep a journal to track mood after waking up and throughout the day, Habits, sleep quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-2">Data Analysis:</h4>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ml-4 mb-4"> Survey results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends between screen use and sleep quality.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Timeline (one semester):</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Week 1-2: Finalize research question and search strategy/IRB approval for survey.</li>
                <li>Week 3-4: Distribute survey through UCF (listservs, clubs, posters, classroom announcements).</li>
                <li>Week 5: Analyze survey responses.</li>
                <li>Week 6-9: Conduct sleep diary/observational study.</li>
                <li>Week 10: Collect and organize organizational data.</li>
                <li>Week 11-12: Full data analysis.</li>
                <li>Week 13-14: Draft research findings.  Finalize and practice presentation for research poster.</li>
                <li>Week 15: Deliver presentation at UCF Student Scholar Symposium.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Expected Outcome:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> After completing this study, the primary deliverable will be a research poster that will be consisted of a summarization of the findings from both the survey as well as components from the observational study.  These findings would also include solutions to reduce sleep issues that are related to screen usage such as app limits, blue light filters, blue light glasses, and sleep hygiene apps.  The poster will display aspects of sleep quality such as the duration, latency, restfulness and the relation to screen use at night for college  students.  The poster will be submitted for presentation through UCFs Student Scholar Symposium for the UCF community and or UCFs Undergraduate Journal.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> Throughout the research and studies done for this project, I have gained so much insight and respect towards all the efforts that are made for a study like this one.  The knowledge gained from this project will continue to grow and expand to other research, studies, and literature that are related to student health.  More specifically with how sleep is affected by screen use and digital devices.  Considering there are not specific sleep studies catered towards college students, this can also be something that can offer new information and perspective on the habits and external stresses and factors of college students and the relation to sleep science.  This is not very studied in sleep research and would be beneficial to behavioral health, sleep science, and neuroscience.  By using a mixed method approach we were able to collect multiple forms of data.  We collected self-reported results, observational data, and numerical data (screen time on phone, sleep report from apps/other devices).  Conducting this study could allow UCF and other colleges to include this these results to better improve their student's well-being and satisfaction.  These findings could be shared with UCF's Health Center and mental or behavioral counseling.  It could also be included in academic advising or resources that would include educational campaigns or posters that could educate students to practice better sleep habits and practices as well as changes they can make to their device before winding down for bed or studying.  This project aims to promote awareness and encourage more research on specific groups such as college students to positively impact the behavior and well-being amongst the community.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Preliminary Work and Experience:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> In high school I took an AP psychology course and other health science classes that allowed me to study basic research methods, human physiology, behavioral science, and the scientific method.  In addition, I have also completed other coursework and projects throughout college that have allowed me to do academic research and source analysis using UCF library databases.  My knowledge in statistics allows me to look at the surveys and data from a more numerical approach that allows me to come to a logical conclusion and co-relate the findings to the relationship between screen usage and sleep quality.  Classes such as anthropology that required me to do research on studies and reports have allowed me to gain the experience that is needed for this project.  These classes and projects helped me gain proficiency in writing in APA style as well as finding reliable sources and citing them properly.  I have also attended UCF workshops and presentations that discuss time management and how to properly execute a project.  Although this will be my first independent study, my experience and knowledge will give me a strong foundation for this project and its success.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">IRB/IACUC:</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4"> This project involved collecting data from human participants and will require IRB approval.  No data will be collected until an IRB application is submitted and approved.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-3">Budget:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
